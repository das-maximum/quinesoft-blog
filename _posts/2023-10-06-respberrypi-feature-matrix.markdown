# RasperryPi Feature Matrix

This post contains a feature matrix of all RaspberryPis including the famous single board computers as well as the micro controller boards.

## Introduction

When searching for a micro controller to use for a simple thermometer, I was also taking a look at the Raspberry Pi Pico.
Having used a RaspberryPi 3+ and 4 already, I took a look at the micro controllers.
Unfortunately the [RasperryPi products page](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/) does not contain a feature matrix.
So therefore I compiled one myself.
